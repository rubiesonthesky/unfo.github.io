I will always read the curated articles and include a small snippet of personal analysis – my two cents – on the links so I am not just churning out links without thinking about them.\r\n\r\nOriginal content I write is still very much in development, I have written mostly about personal career development for the past few months, but that might change.\r\n\r\nI am just experimenting with GitHub pages for now and have not yet decided on my platform.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
