<p>Former developer turned ops, learning reverse engineering (RE) and memory forensics (DFIR). I post about #infosec #sysadmin #malware #vuln #RE (I'll fix these into links eventually.... maybe)</p>

<p>This site is split into two kinds of posts: original content I have written and curated links. I will always read the curated articles and include a small snippet of personal analysis – my two cents – on the links so I am not just churning out links without thinking about them.</p>

<p>Original content I write is still very much in development, I have written mostly about personal career development for the past few months, but that might change.</p>

<p>I am just experimenting with GitHub pages for now and have not yet decided on my platform.</p>
